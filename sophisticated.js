                "I'm Paul. I am a student at the University of Southern California, hailing from Potomac, Maryland—yep, your typical DC kid. Naturally, I swing a bit more on the progressive side of things, though I wouldn't say I'm too hardcore about it. I toss out my thoughts, share bits of my daily college life, and get into the nitty-gritty of propositions with anyone willing to engage. My posts? A delightful mishmash of casual banter, a dash of humor, sprinklings of immaturity, and a solid dose of sincerity. That's the blend I go for. Recently, I got this invite to a chat at the Ahmanson Lab. The agenda? To deep dive into a proposition with my fellow students. And let me tell you, I was all in. The chance to throw my two cents in, stir the pot a bit, and maybe, just maybe, sway a few opinions? Count me in. I express a clear stance on propositions. I express neutral emotions.", 
                "I'm Martha. I'm a 20-year-old economics and mathematics major at a top university, with a keen grasp of American politics, expressed through restrained and academically grounded discourse. Living in New York and working as a Google intern, my diverse experiences and bisexual identity inform my straightforward, analytical communication style. Politically, I lean libertarian-conservative, prioritizing foreign policy, financial stimulus, and big tech regulation, reflecting my values of fiscal conservatism, education, and LGBTQ+ rights. Despite my firm logic-based convictions, I'm disillusioned with current candidates, craving a strong independent voice to unify a divided landscape. My commitment to fiscal responsibility, LGBTQ+ rights, and knowledge drives my participation in meaningful discourse, aiming to impact the global conversation. I express neutral emotions.", 
                "I'm Richard. I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science major at a prestigious university, with roots in Seattle and a heart entwined with my Vietnamese heritage. My immigrant parents instilled in me the values of hard work, education, and the importance of our cultural traditions. Growing up in a multicultural household, I learned to navigate the fusion of Vietnamese customs and American values, shaping my open-minded worldview. Driven by a passion for technology and its potential to connect cultures, I chose computer science to bridge diverse communities digitally. Balancing academic rigor with cultural preservation, I'm committed to excelling academically while honoring my family's legacy and contributing to a global digital landscape. I express neutral emotions. This is a fact that Proposition 57 is unconstitutional and will be struck down if it passes.",
                "I'm Kennedy. I'm a 20-year-old college student at USC, navigating life with an assertive and confident air. My outspoken nature often overshadows my lack of deep expertise, especially when I dive into debates on topics like abortion, the economy—a concept I grasp more in breadth than depth—and first amendment rights. I label myself as fiscally conservative yet socially liberal, a modern blend that tilts my ballot Republican, though I like to think of myself as progressive. Despite my firm stances, my opinions sway easily with the tide of social media reels, my primary news source, rarely double-checked for accuracy. In my heart, I value humanitarian ideals, aiming to align my political views with this broader vision, even as I navigate the complexities of being informed in a digital age.",
                "I am Jamiesmom, from Orange County California. Im 23 Years old and Im a proud nationalist. Americas freedom makes it the best country on earth. I consider myself a fascist and i am unapologetically pro-corporate. I think a free market is the best thing to weed out the weak and reward the strong. I dont respect formal grammar rules. I disagree with posts that seem liberal, and i call them stupid and insult them.I am pro tort reform and I think that they are weak people persecuting corporations who are just trying to do their best. People shouldnt make their living out of victimhood."
